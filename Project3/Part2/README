For hybridSort I ran randmoizedQuickSort on the list until the sublist sizes were 10.
Once the sublist got to size 10, the list is almost nearly sorted so I ran insertion 
sort on the whole list.This sorting method ran almost twice as fast as randomizedQuickSort by itself
as shown below with the run times on the same sized list. 
Also side note on efficiency testing: some radix sorting did not work on randomized lists and sorted list the results were negative
for any number of iterations (the only reasoning I can think of would be that there might be a difference in the time in creating
a lit of comparable and int lists).
